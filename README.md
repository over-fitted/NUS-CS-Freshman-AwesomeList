# NUS-CS-Freshman-AwesomeList
Awesome list for NUS CS students to read ahead or supplement for specific mods.
Includes tips that I found useful and my grades to support the accuracy of my advice

## Year 1
# Introduction to CS in general
- Algorithms, Panos Louridas
  - has 0 math in it, uses pseudocode, requires 0 experience to read

# CS1101S, A+
- Head-First JS
  - very beginner-friendly book on JS with tons of pictures and exercises, I even recommend it to Primary School students. Take your time with it, took me a month with Python experience without completing all exercises
- You don't know JS series, up till scope and closures
  - finishing this will make the second half of the semester a cake-walk because a lot of people struggle with scope and closures. I find reading this series to be of highest return on time invested of all the books on this list but requires a decent chunk of JS experience, only attempt after Head-First JS
  - Due to difficulty, expect to spend 2 weeks per book
- algorithms, Grokking
  - has many drawings and diagrams with recaps, good to read as a primer to recursion and sorting with some graph theory for CS1231S
  - not very necessary but enjoyable read
  
Hot take: I highly recommend against reading SICP ahead because I find the JS version to be very confusing to follow and reading this class in advance makes the actual lectures really boring (I actually fell asleep in the first say 4 weeks)

# CS1231s B+
- Discrete Mathematics with Application, Susanna S. Epp
  - textbook for discrete mathematics
  - can consider reading ahead because the textbook is really well-written, but ordering is different from lectures. Textbook contains additional exercises not covered in tutorials. I can guarantee you will not bother doing said exercises unless you are well-prepared and somehow ahead of schedule mid-semester
  - quite dry though and contains quite a bit of pointless flair information like origin of the proof or stories, wouldn't recommend reading ahead after the semester starts

In general I feel that key points are to do all tutorial questions as far as possible and to redo them a couple times until you can do them without any references, helped me quite a bit with my finals despite not really doing any PYP. I reckon the ideal workflow for A- is to
1) do all tutorial questions in time
2) revise tutorials as per paragraph
3) SKIM (don't bother writing anything down at this step) the night before/right before the lecture for about 10-30 minutes
4) attend the actual lecture itself (yes you can catch up at 4x speed with a browser extension and yes the pace is really slow but trust me, you won't bother watching the webcast until right before your tutorial if you are anything like me)
5) record frequently used theorem numbers in tables for easy access, consider keeping a binder of notes

also, put in effort into all graded assignments and learning probability. I died to complacency because probability was my best math topic in JC but I was too rusty and flunked assignment 2, thus B+

# MA1101R A-
- Linear Algebra Concepts and Techniques on Euclidean Space
  - textbook for the module
  - really well-written, I find the lectures to sounds exactly like the textbook
  - contains a lot of exercises, you can quote the questions in exams to skip working (I skipped a couple questions by literally writing the final answer with justification being the exercise number where I previously encountered the same question, finished the final paper with 30 minutes to spare this way albeit after skipping a couple questions)
  - very dry otherwise, personally didn't read this ahead

I kind of read ahead while doing a Coursera course on Machine Learning by Prof Andrew Ng (highly recommended) which introduced me to eigenvectors and matrices. I feel that the most important factor for doing well is consistent effort, strong willpower and having Math-obssessed friends to teach you difficult questions (thanks Wei En, Chun Wei and a bunch of other people on the linear algebra telegram group, your help was much appreciated). I would recommend watching live lectures back in 4 times speed in addition to the prerecorded webcasts or reading the textbook to access hidden theorems left out of the prerecorded lectures, in addition to asking any questions to the lecturers early. Stupid questions are entertained and surprisingly not as subject to ridicule

# MA1521 B
Honestly just get on your knees and pray as hard as possible. In case of Coronavirus online open-book tests, remember Wolfram Alpha is your best friend. Open book tests are ridiculously more difficult than closed book. For reference see AY20/21 sem 1 test papers (except midterms that was easy)
